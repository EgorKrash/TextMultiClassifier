## RNN model which predicts speaker on USA debates by given text

**Structure**

1. Model
 * ClassifierProject.ipynb - the main notebook where you can find step by step solution 
 
2. App
 * make_prediction.py - script which takes text from input.txt and predicts speaker. It also can take text as system argument
  
I'll make better description later =)
