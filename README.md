## RNN model which predicts speaker on USA debates by given text

**Structure**
* Model
    *ClassifierProject.ipynb - the main notebook where you can find step by step solution 
* App
   * make_prediction.py - script which takes text from input.txt and predicts speaker. It also can take text as system argument
  
I'll make better description later =)
