# RNN model which predicts speaker on USA debates by given text

## Structure

1. Model
 * ClassifierProject.ipynb - the main notebook where you can find solution step by step.
 * model.h5 - saved architecture of my neural network.
 * goodmodel1_weights.h5 - just a weights with which I achieved good accuracy (~0.73).
 
2. App
 * make_prediction.py - script which takes text from input.txt and uses it to predict speaker. It also can take text as system argument.
 So you can play with it two ways:

I'll make better description and quality of images later =)
